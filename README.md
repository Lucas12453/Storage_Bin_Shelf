# Storage Bin Shelf 

## Overview 
Created to organize and centralize stackable storage bins as well as clamps and safety glasses in the APIL workspace. It features 3D printed attachments, including mounts for the storage bins, and a beam that supports the clamps and glasses. The current design can hold 10 storage bins and other attachments on the top. It is completely customizable, able to have attachments swapped out for others. The design of the aluminum extrusions allows for easy installation and customizable features.

## Materials and Equipment 
- Silicone (Smooth-On Mold Star 15 Slow Platinum Silicone Rubber was used here)
- Mold release agent (Mann Release Technologies; Ease Release 200 was used here)  
- Silicone mixing containers  
- 8 x M8 16mm flanged screws  
- 8 x M8 plate nut 
- 3 x M4 18mm screws  
- 1 x M4 nut

### Printing:  
- PLA (polylactic acid) filament  
- 3D printer (a Prusa i3 MK3 printer was used here)

## Parts
- 4 cm x 4 cm (3) Aluminum extrusions *(the lengths are relatively customizable.)* The lengths used here are 15 cm (2) and 76 cm (1)  
- Stabilizers (4)   
- Extrusion connectors (2)  
- Bin mounts (10)  
- Stackable storage bins (10)  
- Attachment mount (1)  
- Hanger beam (1)  
- 5mm diameter rod (1) *(the length used here was 33cm.)*  

## Assembly
1. Place the 2 shorter extrusions at least 3 centimeters away from the ends of the longer extrusion.   
2. Attach the extrusions with the extrusion connectors. Place them facing each other on the inside of the shelf. Use 2 M8 16mm screws on each connector by placing it in the holes. To use the screws, the M8 plate nut must be in the channel within the extrusion. Screw the M8 screw into the plate nut from the outside until it can no longer turn. This should cause a clamping effect, preventing any movement of the extrusions. Do this on every hole of the connector.  
3. Flip the shelf onto its 2 legs and attach the stabilizers. It follows the same principles as before. Place the long end flat on the ground, pointing 90Â° away from the extrusion connector. Screw a M8 16mm screw into another plate nut inside the channel. Do this again for the other side of the leg. Repeat these steps on the other side of the shelf.  
4. Slide on the bin mounts and space them to your preferences. *(We used 5 on each side.)* You can now clip on the storage bins.  
5. To make the hanger attachment, take the attachment mount and match it up with the flat end of the hanger attachment. Use 2 M4 18mm screws to connect the 2\.  
6. Take the 5mm diameter rod and feed it through the holes on the top, including the divided hole in the middle.  
7. Place a M4 nut in the hexagonal cutout on one of the sides of the divided hole in the middle. Take a M4 18mm screw and put it in the other side and then through the nut. Screw it until clamps down on the rod, stopping it from moving  
8. You can now slide that onto the top of the shelf.  
9. Create silicone coverings:  
- Mix a total of 420g of silicone in a 1L container  
- Pour out 210g of Part A silicone into a container  
- Pour out 210g of Part B silicone into the 1L or larger container  
- Pour Part B into the same container as Part A and mix thoroughly. *(Be sure to scrape and incorporate excess silicone on the sides of the container.)* Pour that mixture back into the container that housed Part B and mix in there to include the silicone that was left behind. *(Be wary of the pot life written on the container of the silicone parts, which dictates how long the silicon remains malleable and workable.)*   
- Spray the molds with a light coating of mold release agent, so the removal of the silicone will be easier  
- Take the container and place it inside a vacuum chamber, and turn it on to de-gas the silicone so there are no air bubbles when it cures. When the silicon stops bubbling, take it out of the chamber and pour it into the mold  
- Pour it in a continuous, medium sized stream into the lowest point of the mold to avoid air bubbles.   
- Let the molds sit overnight or for the length of the demold time written on the container of the silicone parts.  
10. Cut off the excess and place them onto the correct locations on the shelf.
